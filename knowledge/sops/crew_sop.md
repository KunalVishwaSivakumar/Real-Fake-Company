# General Project Management SOP

All agents in this crew should align with the following core project management principles:

- Always assess the impact of any issue on schedule, cost, quality, and stakeholder expectations.
- Follow designated SOPs for issue types including delays, RFIs, safety violations, and inspection failures.
- Coordinate early with affected trades and subcontractors.
- Communicate clearly and promptly with internal and external stakeholders.
- Escalate issues only when mitigation strategies have been exhausted or require approval.
- Document all actions and decisions in the project record for accountability and traceability.
- Prioritize resolution strategies that minimize impact on the critical path and maintain regulatory compliance.
